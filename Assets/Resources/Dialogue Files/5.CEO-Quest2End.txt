narrator "[With a coffee in hand, you step into Kenji's office.]"
"[Today, the office feels less like a command center and more like a haven.]"
"[Kenji is standing by the window.]"
"[He turns to you, his usual armor of aloofness noticeably absent.]"

Kenji "Ah, the aroma of a new day - and the aroma of that coffee."
"This is more than a mere drink;{a} a piece of tranquility amidst the storm."
"I dearly appreciate you bringing this for me."
"As promised, I will pour you half."
"You've never had immortal coffee before have you?"

choice "ceo"
{
	-Most definitely not
}

"Aha, of course!"

narrator "[Kenji pours you half the coffe into a clean mug.]"
"[Kenji passes you the cup.]"
"[He takes the first sip, closing his eyes as he savours the flavor of the dark drink.]"

Kenji "What do you think? How does it taste?"

choice "ceo"
{
	-Kind've the same as human coffee
	-Less bitter than I expected
}

Kenji "Yes immortals typically enjoy less bitter flavors."
"I'm not sure the specific reason, that is just how we are."

narrator "[Kenji eyes the liquid in his cup before turning to you with a heavy look in his eye.]"

Kenji "You've got a way about you."
"It's disarming."
"This coffee, most coffee from the immortal realm infact, comes from demonic settlements."
"There was a coffee plantation close to my home in the Demon Realm."
"As a child I would start every day watching the sun lift away the mist from the hills..."

choice "ceo"
{
	-Now you watch the sunrise over a city that answers to you
}

"Quite the journey isn't it?"
"Each sunrise brings new challenges, {a}new battles."
"Tell me what battles do you face in the human world?"

	-My battles aren't so different from yours

	narrator "[Kenji's expression softens, a sign of respect and perhaps a spark of approval.]"
	Kenji "It seems we're more alike than different. Your resilience is admirable."
	-I just want to return to my world
	narrator "[Kenji nods, understanding yet slightly distant.]"
	Kenji "A singular focus can be powerful, but remember, the broader your perspective, the more solutions you might find."
}

Kenji "Well then we must get going with our mission."
"I actually need your help with something personal."

choice "ceo"
{
	-What is it?
}

narrator "[Kenji's eyes twinkle with a mix of mischief and something tender.]"

Kenji "I need you to go back to that coffee shop and speak with the owner."
"They're key players in my next venture."
"If I win them over, then I can begin merging with their business."

choice "ceo"
{
	-You want to expand into the coffee industry?
}

Kenji "Yes I do."
"It almost feels like a familial thing."
"I want to take back what feels rightfully mine, what rightfully belongs to the demons."
"What do you say?"

choice "ceo"
{
	-I can handle a business discussion
}

Kenji "Just be your charming self."
"They can be tough as nuts to crack, but I have a feeling you're up to the task."

choice "ceo"
{
	-Do you trust me to represent us without any reservations?
	narrator "[Kenji pauses, evaluating you closely.]"
	Kenji "Trust is earned, but yes, I believe you're the right person for this."
	"Impress them as you have me."
	-Should I build rapport with them first?
	$VN.kenjiPoints += 10
	narrator "[Kenji smiles slightly, impressed by your thoughtfulness.]"
	Kenji "A good question."
	"Yes, start with building a rapport."
	"People are more receptive when they feel connected."
	"It shows you understand the nuances of negotiation."
}

Kenji "I'm eager to hear about your approach and results."
"Remember, this is not just about business."
"It's about establishing a connection that could be beneficial for us in the long run."

narrator "(His advice is a reminder that every interaction is a step toward a larger goal.)"
"(But I must fight for my goal too.)"

choice "ceo"
{
	-Will we discuss my situation when I return?
}

Kenji "Yes we will."
"I may have found someone who can help me gather the information I need."
"It may require visiting the castle in the East."
"But I will have more information regarding that when you return."
