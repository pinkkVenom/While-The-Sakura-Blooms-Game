narrator "[The cloak feels like vapor, like holding onto a pillowy soft dream.]" 
"[You present it to Kenji. His eyes reflect a storm of emotions.]"

Kenji "This... {a}I never thought I'd see it again. 
"The cloak of invisibility; it's proof of our history, Demonic history, of our people's resilience."
"How can I thank you?"

{
	- But I can't help wondering, why is this cloak so important to you?
}

narrator "[Kenji hesitates, the veneer crumbling to reveal the man beneath.]"

Kenji "My father... {a}he loved the old tales and magical items."
"He believed in the honor behind them."
"This cloak, it's a reminder of who I am beneath the suits and strategies."

narrator "[You step closer, the air charged with a new intimacy.]"

Kenji "You've done more than complete a task."
"You've brought back a piece of my past."
"And... {a} I find myself wanting to share more than just stories with you."

narrator "[Your heart skips a beat, the connection between them now undeniable.]"

Kenji "Dinner, tonight. No talks of tasks or gold. Just... us?"

narrator "[You nod, your smile matching Kenji's - eager and genuine.]"

Kenji "I'm looking forward to it."
"Until then, keep the cloak. It suits you, being wrapped in a piece of my world."

narrator "[As you leave, cloak in hand, you realize you're taking a piece of Kenji's heart with you.]"
"[Some time passes...]"
"[Following an evening that had been both revealing and intimate, you return to Kenji’s office.]"
"[Memories of shared laughter and lingering looks over dinner the night before add a new layer to your connection.]"
"[Kenji stands by his desk, anticipation etched in his posture.]"
"[His usual stoic facade is replaced by an openness, a direct result of the night prior.]"

Kenji "There you are."
"I must admit, last night’s dinner has left me with a sense of... expectation for our encounters. "
"Now, I have another important task – my family's heirloom, an old ring, has gone missing much like the cloak."
"It’s always guided us through trials and triumphs, and now I need it —{a}need you— {a}to guide it back to me."

narrator "[Kenji’s eyes soften, the corner of his mouth lifting in an appreciative smile.]"

Kenji "You are someone who I can trust get my tasks done for me."
"Your tenacity is as endearing as it is impressive."
"The ring was last seen in my home town village. Begin your search there..."
"The demon area is west of the city."
"Once you get to the Main road, head north, then head west from there."
"The landscape of the region is very unique."
"Demonic areas are coverd in a lot of purple foliage."
"Once you see that, you'll know you're there."
