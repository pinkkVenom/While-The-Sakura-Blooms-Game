<mainChar> "(My bond with Emi is very strong.)"
"(Although I am hesitant, I must tell her about the amulet and it's true power.)"

"That reminds me, I was never able to find information from clients regarding it."
"Have you discovered something perhaps?"

narrator "[You reveal the amulet, its surface glimmering with a light that's not quite of this realm.]"

Emi “Trapped? In there? That’s... hard to believe."

narrator "[You focus on the amulet, channeling a silent plea for the good leader to reveal themselves.]"
"[The amulet glows brightly, and a translucent figure emerges, the visage of the good faction leader becoming clear.]"
"[Emi stands, shock apparent on her features.]"

Emi "Oh my god."
"It really is him."

narrator "[Emi gathers her thoughts, pacing the studio with a furrowed brow, brushes clutched in hand.]"
"[A moment later, she stops and turns to face you, a spark of inspiration in her eyes.]

Emi "Okay we will head to the Castle as soon as possible then."
"The guards will be expecting us so we shouldn't have any trouble getting in."
"Meet me there as soon as you can."
