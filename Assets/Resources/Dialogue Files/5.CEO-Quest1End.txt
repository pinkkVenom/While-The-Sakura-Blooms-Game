narrator "[Kenji looks up from a sea of paperwork, his facade of indifference slipping ever so slightly at the sight of you.]"

Kenji "Back so soon? And with a full purse, I presume?"

<mainChar> "(His suprise is almost a compliment. Did he underestimate me, or is it all part of the test?)"

choice "ceo"
{
	-*shows money* Yes, here's all 5000
	- This should cover it right?
}

Kenji "I must say {a}I'm pleasantly surprised."
"Gathering this much gold must not have been easy considering you were empty-handed a short while ago."
"But, as I said, good marketing skills go a long way."

narrtor "[Kenji takes the coins from you and inspects them.]"

Kenji "May I ask, did you take my advice to sell to the woman at the Diamond Store?"

choice "ceo"
{
	-Yes I did
}

Kenji "I'm impressed."
"It was wise of you to take my advice on such a matter."
"I am more knowledgable than you after all."
"Now, for the next task {a}my day would not be complete without a rare coffee blend."
"It's a ritual, a brief respite in my world of chaos."
"Fetch it for me."

choice "ceo"
{
	-Seriously?
	-A trivial task?
}

Kenji "I have been very overworked."
"A delicious coffee is the most effective way for me to continue helping for your cause."
"But your frustration is only fair, so allow me to give you some information."
"I have spoken to some sources regarding this amulet you possess."
"Many of them are actually interested in purchasing this item as a collectors piece."

choice "ceo"
{
	-Isn't this amulet a forbidden artifact?
}

Kenji "Yes it is. It's forbidden because of it's immense magical properties."
"That is why it is so sought after by those who oppose the Kagayaku."
"The Kagayaku banned magical items liek this one, but it doesn't make sense considering how much potential these items have."

choice "ceo"
{
	-The woman at the Diamond Store also wanted to purchase the amulet
}

Kenji "Yes, I'm aware of her interest in this item."

choice "ceo"
{
	-That's why you sent me to her...
	-You wanted to see if I would give into greed
}

Kenji "You're a lot smarter than you appear."
"It would be foolish of you to accept the extra money considering you won't survive long here anyways."
"My test was a judge of your character."
"And you passed."
"You've earned my trust human."
"That being said, if you fetch me the coffee, we can thoroughly discuss a plan to get you out of this world."

choice "ceo"
{
	-Where can I find the coffee?
}

Kenji "There is a coffee shop north from here, in the Art District."
"Perhaps there you will find what I need."

choice "ceo"
{
	-May I share the coffee with you?
}

narrator ([Kenji studies you for a moment, then smirks.])

Kenji "You drive a hard bargain."
"Very well, bring me the coffee, and we'll share it as equals {a}for a moment"
