narrator "[The library is bathed in the golden glow of afternoon light as you arrive.]"
"[Yuki is rearranging a section of books, but he pauses and brightens upon noticing you.]"
"Yuki steps away from the shelves, adjusting his hair with a thoughtful air.]"

Yuki "Good to see you. I've been pondering over the amulet dilemma."
"Before we dive into the books, how was Alice?"

choice "ceo"
{
	-She returned the book
}

Yuki "Okay good good."
"Thanks for that by the way."
"I hope she didn't give too much trouble."

choice "ceo"
{
	-She wanted to apoligize for returning the book late
}

Yuki "Aww, she's too kind."
"Normally she brings her books back well before they're due."
"Oh well, things happen sometimes."
"You know better than anyone."

narrator "[Yuki's lips quirk up in a small, knowing smile.]"

Yuki "Now, I've found some additional books and scrolls about ancient artifacts."
"If you'd like to sit down, then we can both start doing some research into your case."

narrator "[You sit next to Yuki at a rectangular table.]"

Yuki "Now that everything is in place..."
"Hold on a second."
"Ugh, where is my pen?"
"I swear I keep losing it."
"I need it to be able to take important notes, and mark pages of interest."

choice "ceo"
{
	-I could find you another pen
}

Yuki "Yes please, I would really appreciate that."
"Any pen will do at this point."
"If you head north from there to the downtown district there might be a pen you can snag there."
"You know...office buildings have a lot of those."
"I'll get a head start on skimming through these texts."
"Maybe I'll have a breakthrough before you return."
