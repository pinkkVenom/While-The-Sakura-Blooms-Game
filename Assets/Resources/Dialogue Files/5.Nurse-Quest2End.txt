narrator "[Hanako is exactly where you left her, though now there's a hint of anticipation as she awaits their return.]"

Hanako "You found it!"
"Oh, I knew you would. You have a natural gift for this, it seems."
"This bluebell will help many people get the medicine they need. Thank-you."

{
	-It was an interesting journey
	-The forest here is quite lively
}

narrator "[A gentle laugh escapes Hanako, her demeanor as soothing as the remedies she prepares.]"

Hanako "Lively is one way to put it."
"Also I'm trying to find a way to help you get back home."
"I keep running into the same conclusion though..."
"Which is that the Empress likely has the most knowledge on how to help."
"I'm gonna think of a way for us to get to the Palace."
"It's not like her to invite just anyone in, you know?"

choice "ceo"
{
	-Makes sense
	-I understand
}

Hanako "Excellent!"
"Now, if you're up for it I have another task for you."
"There is another herb I've been trying to find forever but I can't seem to locate where it grows."
"It's called a Tsukimi Plant."
"It's said they only bloom during a full moon"
It’s said to have healing properties that are almost... magical."

choice "ceo"
{
	-It sounds beautiful
	-Is it still around?
}

narrator "[Hanako sighs, a wistful smile on her lips.]"

Hanako "I haven't seen it since I was a child."
"But if it does still exist, it would be a treasure to behold, a link to happier times."
"I wonder if anyone could ever find it again."

choice "ceo"
{
	-Maybe I could look for it?
}

narrator "[Hanako’s eyes widen, the idea taking root.]"

Hanako "Would you? That's so kind of you."
"But it's just an old tale from my mother but I remember her saying it only blooms on a full moon and one is coming up I believe."
"If it were true, though, finding it would be... It would mean so much to me."
"If I remember correctly, they grow in cold climates."
"If you head west to the Main Road, then north, and then east, you will get to the cold mountains."
"Perhaps begin your exploration there."
"Also when you return.."
"I'd like to know more about you... and perhaps share more about myself."

choice "ceo"
{
	-Sounds good
	-I look forward to hearing everything about you

narrator "[As you set off on your new task, you feel a bond forming with the kind nurse.]"
