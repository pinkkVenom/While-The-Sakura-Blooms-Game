narrator "[Hanako greets you at the reception desk, giddy that you've returned.]"

Hanako "Did you find it?"
"You didn't suffer any hypothermia or severe cold effects did you?"

choice "ceo"
{
	-I'm okay, but I couldn't find it
}

narrator "[Hanako had a brief look of disapointment on her face.]"
"[But she quickly smiled at you.]"

Hanako "Hey <mainChar> it's okay."
"It's been so long since those plants have been spotted in the wild."
"If I'm being honest, I believe most of them died off from the rebel wars several years ago."
"The Tsukimi Plants have incredible power, yet they are so fragile to violence."
"Much like humans in a way."
"Even being in a hostile environment is enough to wither a person away."
"It's alright you didn't find the plant really."
"And I appreciate your efforts greatly."
"I have also secured us a visit to the Palace."
"We will attend as healers and visit the elderly nobles to assess their medical conditions."
"You have a chance at getting home now dear."

narrator "[Hanako's eyes reflect a multitude of emotions, at the idea of your departure.]"

Hanako "Now as promised, I will share a bit about myself."

choice "ceo"
{
	-Yes please
}

Hanako "Hmm...{a}what should I start with?"
"Well I suppose you don't know much about immortal species."
"I am a Caladrius."
"It's in my nature to be a healer really."
"My parents also loved to offer their healing abilities to those in need."
"Unfortunately, when the war broke out so many people needed help."
"We took in as many injured as we could, but we were quickly overwhelmed and under-supplied."
"That's when my mother went looking for the Tsukimi Plant, as a last ditch effort to help as many as we could."
"Despite the fact that she was wearing a healer's uniform, she got caught in crossfire between the rebels and the Empress' soldiers."
"My father went out to look for her..."
"She was injured, but not in critical condition."
"She did find the Tsukimi Plant, but it was so withered, so decayed."
"That's why I've always suspected the war made the plants disappear."
"That was the last time I ever saw the Tsukimi Plant."
"My mother did recover well, and we did our best to help everyone who came to us for healing."
"Good riddance the war is over now."
"Even though we have an established hospital, we don't have enough staff to help that many people."
"It's a terrible thing really."

choice "ceo"
{
	-I'm very sorry Hanako
}

"It was a long time ago."
"And I'm doing much better now."
"My parents are doing well, and I feel very happy with my life and my job."

choice "ceo"
{
	-I would like to get you something to cheer you up
}

narrator "[Hanako blushes as your kind offer.]"

Hanako "Oh...um...okay sure."
"That's very sweet of you."
"Mmm speaking of something sweet..."
"I would love some dango right now."
"It's one of my favorite snacks."
"If you head north from here, you'll enter the art district."
"There's a dango shop right there."
"They always have plenty in stock."

choice "ceo"
{
	-I'll get right on it!

Hanako "Thank-you!"
"And make sure to get one for yourself to try."
