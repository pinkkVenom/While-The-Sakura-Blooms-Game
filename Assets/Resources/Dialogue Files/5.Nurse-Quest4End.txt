narrator "[Hanako was a bit pre-occupied with work to notice you come into the reception area.]"
"[While she wasn't looking, you offer her a stick of dango.]"

Hanako "Oh my!"
"I'm so sorry I didn't see you there."
"This dango looks and smells delicious!"
"I appreciate this dearly <mainChar>."
"You did get one for yourself yes?"

{
	-Yes I have some for myself
}

Hanako "Excellent!"
"Let us enjoy a delicious snack after a long day."

narrator "[Hanako eats her dango methodically, making sure to savor every bite.]"
"[You try to match the pace she's eating at.]"
"[Everytime Hanako looks to you, her smile radiates warmth and happiness.]"

<mainChar> "(Hanako and I share a special, magical bond.)"
"(I must tell her of my amulet and it's secret powers.)"

narrator "[The hospital room, usually a beacon of sterile tranquility, feels suddenly charged with an electric tension.]"
"[Hanako, whose demeanor is as calming as the medicinal herbs she often administers, looks upon you with a focused intent that belies her usually gentle nature.]"

Hanako "Is something wrong <mainChar>?"

choice "ceo"
{
	-You won't believe what I'm about to tell you
}

narrator "[Clutching the amulet that has become the heart of this unfolding mystery.]"

Hanako "In my time, I have witnessed the unbelievable become reality."
"Speak, I am listening."

choice "ceo"
{
	-The leader of the Kagayaku is trapped in this amulet
}

Hanako "That... that is a heavy burden to bear."
"Are you certain of this?"

choice "ceo"
{
	-Please, Hanako, we need your help
}

Hanako "Show me then."
"If what you say is true, I must see with my own eyes."

narrator "[Concentrating on the amulet, the essence of the Kagayaku leader is revealed.]"

Hanako "By the healing blossoms... {a}it’s true."

choice "ceo"

	"I will stand with you."

{
	Hanako "This is more than I ever expected to face... but I cannot turn away from someone in need, not when it matters most."
}


narrator "[Hanako steps forward, showing solidarity.]"

Hanako "Together, then. Let’s head to the Palace."
"We must travel all the way west from here, west of the Main Road."
"Let us hope the light guides us well."
