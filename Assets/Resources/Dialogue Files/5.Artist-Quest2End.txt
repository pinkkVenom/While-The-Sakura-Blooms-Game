narrator "[The studio feels warmer, more intimate, yet also somewhat heavy.]"
"[There is an important story behind Emi's paintings, and you've come to discover the truth.]"
"[But first, you share more of your views on Emi's paintings.]"
"[She listens to your opinions intently.]"

Emi "Your perspective is refreshing."
"To see my work through your eyes... it's as if I'm discovering it anew."
"It’s funny, isn’t it, how art can bridge worlds?"

choice "ceo"
{
	-Your paintings did more than that
	-They spoke of passion, of struggle, of triumph. It was... inspiring
}

narrator "[Emi leans in, her proximity closing the space between artist and muse.]"

Emi "You inspire me too."
"There's an artistry in the way you view the world, in the way you've embraced this quest of yours."
"I find myself drawn to it... to you."
"I've also found a way I might be able to help you get back home."
"I mentioned previously that the Empress has seen and enjoyed my works."
"Well...since she's an incredibly powerful and all knowing immortal, I thought I could maybe ask her about you."

choice "ceo"
{
	-Do you think she will let us talk to her?
}

Emi "Sure I think so."
"I've sent a letter to her castle offering to create a custom piece for her."
"I'm confident she'll get back to me quickly."
"Or someone from her staff perhaps..."
"Either way, I believe that's your ticket home."

narrator "[You feel the weight of her words, the shared understanding of two souls meeting not just in task, but in spirit.]"

choice "ceo"
{
	-Emi I need to ask you about your paintings
}

narrator "[Emi's cheerful mood suddenly dampens.]"
"[She takes a deep breath before speaking.]"

Emi "It's a very emotional story for me."
"I'm not sure that I'm ready to share it with you just yet."
"However, I do need another item for my studio."
"I promise if you get me what I need then I'll tell you more about my story."

choice "ceo"
{
	-Of course
	-What do you need?
}

Emi "I am looking for a specific paintbrush."
"Perhaps you could venture around the world and find it for me."
"If you venture south of here, to the library district, then you might have some luck finding it there."
"Try looking around the shops located there."
"They might have what I need in stock."
"..."
"I'm sorry {a}I'm not as open as I should be."

choice "ceo"
{
	-Don't worry Emi, I respect your decision
}

Emi "Thank-you <mainChar>."
"I'll see you when you get back."
