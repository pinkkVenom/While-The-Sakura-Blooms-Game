narrator "[Kenji is perched on the edge of his desk, as if he's been waiting for this very moment]"

Kenji "I was wondering if I'd see the clumsy human again."
"You're quite determined, or desperate perhaps."

choice "ceo"
{
	-Determination keeps me going
	-I'm not desperate...
}

Kenji "That would make sense given your situation, {a}wouldn't it?"
"I have to be honest with you <mainChar>..."
"I haven't spoken to my sources yet."

<mainChar> "(This was a setback I wasn't prepared for)"

choice "ceo"
{
	-What? Why not?
	-I was hoping for some progress.
}

Kenji "I would be risking a lot by helping you from the kindness of my own heart."
"I'm not known for doing charity."
"Besides, how do I know you aren't actually plotting something malicious?"
"I won't know until you do this...{a}simple task for me."

<mainChar> "(A test then. I need to pass this to earn his trust.)"

choice "ceo"
{
	-You set a challenge, and I'm here to rise to it.
}

Kenji "Alright, here's the play:"
"The markets are a maelstrom right now."
"And only the cunning, such as myself, know how to navigate it's currents."

choice "ceo"
{
	-There's an immortal stock market?
}

Kenji "Indeed there are. Several in fact."
"Now listen, I would like you to bring me 5000 dollars."
"It's the first piece in a puzzle that could help us both."
"I also want to see how...{a}competent of a salesperson you are."
"Consider this an insurance policy, for me of course."

choice "ceo"
{
	-How can I earn that much money?
}

Kenji "Anything can be sold with some good marketing skills."
"If I were you, I would start by talking to vendors."
"There are some out and about, such as the kind woman at the Diamond Store."
"Perhaps you could find something of value to sell to her."

choice "ceo"
{
	-Where is the diamond store?
}

Kenji "The diamond store is located west of the Downtown district."
"It's a bright golden store."
"Shouldn't be too hard to locate."

choice "ceo"
{
	-I'll get it done, but I'm not a pawn in your game.
}

Kenji "Oh, I don't doubt it."
"Pawns can become queens in the right hands after all."
"Go on then {a}surprise me"
