narrator "[Hanako’s eyes shine, reflecting a depth of emotion.]"

Hanako "You have a gift for this, truly."
"You’re not just a visitor from another world; you’re a healer in your own right. It's... it's very touching to see."

narrator "[You notice the slight tremble in her voice, the way she lingers on your words.]"

narrator "[A blush creeps over Hanako's cheeks, her gaze lingering on the player with a mixture of admiration and something deeper.]"

Hanako "I... um, I've grown quite fond of our talks, and I find myself looking forward to seeing you."
"It’s more than just the help you’ve given. You have a way of making everything feel... hopeful."

narrator "[You step closer, drawn by the sincerity in her voice.]"
"[Hanako meets your gaze, her smile timid but genuine.]"

Hanako "I've never met anyone like you before, and I... I would like to explore this feeling more, if you would?"

narrator "[The connection between you is undeniable now, a seed of affection that has taken root and begun to blossom.]"
"[In this clinic of healing, you've found something else to nurture – the tender beginnings of a romance.]"

Hanako "I have another favor to ask, and it's an important task for this tonic I'm making."
"I need a bluebell from the forest."
"It has some unique healing properties that I need for this mixture."
"The forest is west of the city."
"Head to the Main Road, then head south."
"There will be a huge number of trees and flowers there."
"The bluebells are unique in color so it shouldn't be too hard to spot."
"I'll be eagerly awaiting your return."
