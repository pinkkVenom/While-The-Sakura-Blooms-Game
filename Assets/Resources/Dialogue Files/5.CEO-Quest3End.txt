narrator "[Kenji looks up as the player enters, a satisfied grin speading across his face.]"

Kenji "Your reputation precedes you. I've already heard from the businessmen. They were... thoroughly charmed."

<mainChar> "(The recognition feels good, but I can't let it go to my head.)"
"(There's always another challenge around the corner with Kenji.)"

narrator "[Kenji's expression grows earnest]"

Kenji "I knew you were more than capable for the job."
"And I now have a new business contact for my future investments."
"I thank-you you for that."
"Now allow me to share some information with you."
"Merging with the coffee shop isn't simply for me to grow my business."
"I have sent a proposal to the Royal Castle to bring some samples of the product for the Empress."
"I am awaiting a response from them."

{
	-What are you looking to get from the Empress?
}

Kenji "You will be joining me there as a business associate."
"The Empress is the most powerful immortal in the realm after the disapearance of the Kagayaku leader."

<mainChar> "(It seems even Kenji doesn't know the exact details of the Kagayaku leaders disapearance.)"

Kenji "The Empress might be able to help you get back home."
"At least that's the plan right now."
"Now, <mainChar>..."
"You have shown resilience thus far, for a mere human in our immortal realm you have outdone yourself."
"This next task I ask of you is like no other."
"I had once in my possession {a} a cloak of invisibility."
"It was stolen from me, and I have not since been able to find it."

<mainChar> "(A cloak of invisibility? Sounds like we're stepping out of the realm of business and into more personal matters.)"

choice "whats wrong"
{
	-The cloak of invisibility?
	-What happened that it got lost?

}

Kenji "The last information I had about it was from a colleague of mine."
"He said some imps in the forest west of the city were spotted with an purple piece of fabric."
"I don't imagine they will be too keen on returning it empty-handed."

<mainChar> "(Dealing with imps for a mythical cloak?)"
"(This is far from what I expected when I got involved with Kenji.)"
"(But if it's a test of my abilities or my resolve, I'll meet it head-on.)"

Kenji "If you manage to find the cloak, I'll tell you more about myself."
"As well as the plan to head to the Castle."
"I wish you the best of luck."
