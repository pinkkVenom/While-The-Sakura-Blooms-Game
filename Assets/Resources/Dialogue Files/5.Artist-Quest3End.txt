narrator "[Emi awaits with a quiet excitement, which breaks into a radiant smile as you present the brush.]"

Emi "You found it!"
"Only someone with a true artist's soul could have located exactly what I was looking for."

narrator "[Emi’s cheeks flush with a soft rose hue.]"

Emi "To be seen through your eyes, to be... {a}understood, it means more to me than I can say."
"And, as promised, I must tell you more about my past."

narrator "[Emi takes a deep breath before beginning her story.]"

Emi "Long ago, when I was only a little girl, I used to live with the wealthy in the Castle."
"I had so many siblings, most of them were so wonderful and talented compared to me."
"So my parents didn't pay mind to me or my brother since we were the least gifted of the bunch."
"My parents however got unlawfully punished."

<mainChar> "(She speaks of her family as if they are no more...)"

Emi "My family had always supported the Empress before she came into power."
"They believed in her values and what she stood for."
"But, because my family was so influential..."
"The leader of the Kagayaku had given them the ultimate punishment for their alliance with the Empress."
"My brother and I were spared because they deemed us worthless members to society."
"No family, no money, no influence."
"Eventually I made a life for myself as an artist."
"My brother had a difficult time handling the loss of our family."
"He set off to travel the world."
"But when the Empress came into power, she recognized me."
"She had always felt terrible sorrow for me and my brother."
"I do trust her a lot, and I appreciate her more than your know."
