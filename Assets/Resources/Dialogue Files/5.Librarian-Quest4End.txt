narrator "[Yuki is reorganizing a section when you enter, the recovered book in hand.]"
"[He stops abruptly, his heart on his sleeve as he sees the tome.]"

Yuki "Is that...?"
"Can it truly be 'The Book of Countless Travels'?"

narrator "[You present the book to Yuki, and as he takes it, his hands tremble with emotion.]"

	-This is your heritage, Yuki

[Yuki opens the book, his parents' notes and thoughts interwoven with the text.]
[He looks up at you, eyes brimming.]

Yuki "This... This is a piece of my soul returned to me."
"Thank you doesn't begin to cover what I'm feeling right now."
"This book... it was their legacy, and now it's ours."

narrator "[You watch as Yuki composes himself, the silent strength in his posture belying the tears he blinks away.]"

Yuki "You've done something incredible today."
"You've brought back the voices of my past, and with them, you've given me a future filled with hope."
"A future I long to explore, with you by my side."

narrator "[The intimacy of the moment is palpable, the connection between you deepening beyond words.]"

Yuki "I've lived a life surrounded by stories, but I never anticipated being part of one so profound."
"You've entered my story, not as a fleeting character, but as the co-author of the next chapter."

narrator "[Yuki steps closer, his usual reserve cast aside.]"

Yuki "I am, quite simply, smittened. With the person who walked into my library and changed everything."

narrator "[In the quiet sanctuary of the library, surrounded by the echoes of countless tales, you and Yuki stand together, your own story just beginning.]"

<mainChar> "(Considering our growing intimacy, it's time to let Yuki know about the amulets hidden powers.)"

	-Yuki, there's something important I need to tell you.

Yuki "Oh? What's that? You always have the most interesting stories."

	-It's about this amulet... and the leader of the Kagayaku.

[Yuki's hands pause, books half-forgotten. His brow furrows as he looks at you more intently.]
Yuki "The good faction leader? That sounds quite serious. What about them?"
Player "The leader is trapped inside this amulet. I need to get back to the human world, and they're my key home."
Player "This is going to sound crazy, but the good faction leader is sealed within my amulet. And I think they can help me return to my world."
[Yuki shocked] 
Yuki "Inside the amulet? That's... rather unbelievable. Are you certain?"
Player "I can prove it. Just watch."
[You hold out the amulet, concentrating on the presence within. A glow begins to emanate from the jewel at its core.]
[The figure of the good faction leader materializes, regal and imposing, even as an apparition.]
Good Faction Leader "Yuki Tanaka, your help is crucial. We must reach the palace to confront the bad leader and restore balance."
[Yuki astonished] 
Yuki "This... This is extraordinary."
Player "Yuki, I need you. Will you help us get to the palace?"
Player "It's going to be dangerous, but we could really use your knowledge and bravery."
[Yuki determined] 
Yuki "For you, I'd walk into the storm itself. Lead the way, my friend."
[You feels a rush of gratitude]
[Yuki hesitant] 
Yuki "This is... a lot to take in. But I cannot ignore the plight before us. I will assist you."
[You feels a rush of relief]
Player "Thank you, Yuki. With your help, I know we can do this."
[You prepare to leave the library, the weight of the journey ahead looming, but with Yuki by your side, you feel ready to face whatever may come.]
[Yuki paces back and forth, deep in thought, the spectral leader of the good faction watching on with patient gravity.]
Yuki "If we are to enter the palace without raising suspicion, we need a valid reason for our visit."
[He stops suddenly, snapping his fingers as the idea takes shape in his mind.]
Yuki "I've got it! The palace's library is vast, and they often acquire new volumes. It's customary for them to invite librarians to catalog new additions."
Player "That's brilliant! But how do we convince them to let us in?"
Yuki "I have connections with the palace's head archivist. I've aided them before with rare texts. They trust my expertise."
[He pulls out an ornate, feathered quill and a piece of parchment, scribbling a message.]
Yuki "I'll send word that I've come across a unique collection of books that could greatly enrich their library."
[He seals the letter with a stamp emblazoned with an intricate 'Y'.]
Player "Do you think they'll believe it?"
Player "What if they become suspicious?"
[Yuki confident] 
Yuki "They will. I've never offered false information before. My reputation will grant us entry."
[Yuki reassuring] 
Yuki "It's a risk, but a calculated one. My credibility is not so easily questioned."
[You nods, understanding the delicacy of the situation.]
Player "Once we're in, how do we find the bad leader without drawing attention to ourselves?"
Yuki "We'll split up. I'll take the lead in the library, drawing their focus. You'll have the opportunity to search for the leader."
