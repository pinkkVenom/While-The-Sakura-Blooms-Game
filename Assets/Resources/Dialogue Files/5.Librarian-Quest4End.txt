"[He stops abruptly, his heart on his sleeve as he sees the tome.]"

[Yuki opens the book, his parents' notes and thoughts interwoven with the text.]
[He looks up at you, eyes brimming.]

Yuki "This... This is a piece of my soul returned to me."
"Thank you doesn't begin to cover what I'm feeling right now."
"This book... it was their legacy, and now it's ours."

Yuki "You've done something incredible today."
"You've brought back the voices of my past, and with them, you've given me a future filled with hope."
"A future I long to explore, with you by my side."

narrator "[The intimacy of the moment is palpable, the connection between you deepening beyond words.]"

Yuki "I've lived a life surrounded by stories, but I never anticipated being part of one so profound."
"You've entered my story, not as a fleeting character, but as the co-author of the next chapter."

narrator "[Yuki steps closer, his usual reserve cast aside.]"

Yuki "I am, quite simply, smittened. With the person who walked into my library and changed everything."

[Yuki's hands pause, books half-forgotten. His brow furrows as he looks at you more intently.]
