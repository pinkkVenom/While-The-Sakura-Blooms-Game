narrator "[Yuki is at his desk, surrounded by stacks of books, but he stands to greet you.]"

Yuki "Welcome back."
"Please tell me you found it."

choice "ceo"
{
	-Indeed I did
}

narrator "[Yuki's demeanor softens, a spark of kinship in his eyes.]"

Yuki "I'm so happy to hear this."
"Please don't tell anyone this was ever lost."
"My boss would kill me."
"Now let's examine this scroll..."
"There should be information on important immortal artifacts here."

narrator "[Yuki examines the pages intently.]"
"[He's skimming the text faster than you can keep up with.]"

Yuki "What..?"
"There's nothing here?"
"I could've sworn this was the solution for you."
"There isn't any information on any kind of magical amulets here."

choice "ceo"
{
	-That's okay, let's find another scroll
}

Yuki "I'm not sure what else is in our catalog that could help."
"Actually wait..."
"The Palace archives have the largest library collection in the realm."
"Even larger than our collection here."

choice "ceo"
{
	-How can we get to the Palace?
}

Yuki "Well it's not gonna be easy."
"I'm gonna have to think about a plan for that."
"While I think of a brilliant solution, I need you to do something else for me."
"This woman is late on returning her borrowed books."
"Normally I would go find her myself, but since I'm researching for you right now..."

choice "ceo"
{
	-I will go find her
}

Yuki "Ah! I knew you'd jump at the opportunity."
"She should be located at the temple."
"The temple is in the art district which is north of here."
"You have to travel north to downtown, and then north again to the art district."
"Then look towards the west side of the area."
"Also the woman's name is Alice, so make sure to ask around for her."
"Please come back once you finish the task."
