narrator "[You presents the ring to Kenji, who handles it with a reverence that speaks volumes of its significance.]"
"He sets it gently on the desk, his focus entirely on you.]"

Kenji "You've done more than retrieve a lost item; you've brought back a piece of history, a token of my family's path."
"And after our dinner, I can't help but feel you’re part of that path."

<mainChar> "(His words resonate with an unexpected intensity.)"
"(Is this the moment where everything changes?)"

narrator "[Kenji steps around the desk, closing the distance.]"

Kenji "Last night, we shared stories and dreams over dinner."
"Today, you've turned those dreams into a tangible reality."
"I find myself very open with you."
"I can't say I've ever felt that way for someone before."

narrator "[Kenji’s voice is low, earnest.]"

Kenji "I’m suggesting that maybe it’s time we explore this new journey together."
"Not as CEO and associate, but as Kenji and... well, as two people who have found something rare."

<mainChar> "(This is uncharted territory. Am I prepared to navigate it with him?"
"(His gaze holds a promise of something more, something beyond the confines of this office.)"

narrator "[You meet his gaze, and in it, you see the reflection of your own heart.]"

Kenji "You've navigated the city, the tasks, and found your way to the core of my world."
"Now, I find myself at a crossroads, with this heirloom, with you."
"And I choose us."

narrator "[In the quiet of the office, with the city as your witness, you come together.]"
"[Not just in proximity but on purpose, your shared path now clear.]"

<mainChar> "(I have an important relationship with Kenji now.)"
"(Far beyond what I had expected.)"
"(It is time to talk to him about my amulet, and the leader of the Kagayaku.)"
