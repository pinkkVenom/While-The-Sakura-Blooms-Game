GoodFaction as Ominous Man "Don't worry, you're under my protection now."

choice "do you like cats or dogs"
{
	-Woah!
	-Who are you?!
}

GoodFaction as Kagayaku Leader "I am the leader of the Kagayaku Chokugo."
"In truth, I must thank you."
"If it wasn't for you, I would've been trapped in that amulet a long time."

choice "do you like cats or dogs"
{
	-Wait aren't you the true Emperor?
	-Aren't you supposed to be at the castle?
}


GoodFaction as Kagayaku Leader "I was trapped in this amulet by Empress of the Mizube no Ikiryo, the usurper."
"She isn't supposed to be in the castle right now, nor was she supposed to use forbidden magic, but here we are."

choice "do you like cats or dogs"
{
	-Is that how I got transported here?
}

GoodFaction as Kagayaku Leader "Unfortunately, yes."
"The Empress cursed me into this amulet using ancient magic that has long been forbidden."
"The amulet's power awoke when you decided to wear it."
"Believe it or not, humans have enough life force to awaken such a device because it requires very little energy."
"I had to outlaw the magic because too many immortals were entering the human realm and disrupting their world."
"I knew some immortals hated this rule, but I never imagined they would overthrow their rightful ruler in an act of defiance."
"Can you help me <mainChar>?"

choice "do you like cats or dogs"
{
	-I want to. What can I do?
	-This sounds dangerous. How can I be sure I can help?
}

GoodFaction as Kagayaku Leader "I need to get back to the castle."
"Even though I am no longer dormant in the amulet, the full potential of my powers isn't available to me."
"I must get to the throne so that I may become corporeal once again."

choice "do you like cats or dogs"
{
	-How can I trust you?
}

GoodFaction as Kagayaku Leader "Do you have a choice in the matter?"
"I would send you back home right now if I could, but as I said I need to regain my true form at the castle."
"And I cannot do that until you take me there."
"You have my word I will help you return home."


choice "do you like cats or dogs"
{
	-Okay, I will do my best to help you.
}

GoodFaction as Kagayaku Leader "Thank you, human."
"I know I am a stranger to you, but I sincerely appreciate all that you have done for me."
"And I must apologize for putting you in this dangerous situation."

choice "do you like cats or dogs"
{
	-Dangerous?
	-Apologize?
}


GoodFaction as Kagayaku Leader "You cannot stay in the immortal realm long."
"As a human, you become weaker the longer you stay here."
"And once we get to the palace, the Empress won't be so welcoming once she realizes your intentions."
"But I will do everything in my power to protect the kind and brave human who helped restore balance to the immortal realm."
"These sakura trees are from the human realm."
"Ancient immortals were obsessed with the botania in your world."
"The only plant type that truly stuck around were the sakura trees."
"This large sakura is sacred."
"It was the first one of it's kind planted here."
"This tree is imbued with magical power linked to your life force."
"Right now the trees are pink and blooming, but the longer you remain here, the more the trees will wilt and even decay if your life force is on its last leg."
"Keep this in mind while you're here."
"Also, there's one more important thing."
"Don't tell any of the immortals about this."
"About me being alive."
"It's been a few decades now that I've been gone, and every immortal has taken a side."
"My side, or the Empress' side."
"I don't want to put you at any more risk."

choice "do you like cats or dogs"
{
	-Okay, I understand. I won't tell anyone about you.
	-But what if someone suspects something?
}

GoodFaction as Kagayaku Leader "Trust me, it is safer for you to keep this a secret."
"Come now."
"You must continue our mission."
"You have the choice of speaking with Hanako, Yuki, Emi, or Kenji."
"The immortal you speak to next will be locked into your story."
"Choose wisely, as your choice cannot be changed once you speak to the one you wish to befriend."
