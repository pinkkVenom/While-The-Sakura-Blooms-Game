Hanako "A patient of mine needs some medication."
"But they aren't able to come pick it up from the hospital right now."
"Would you mind delivering it to them?"

"Shouldn't be too hard to find."
"I've included the consumption instructions with their medication."
"Please let them know I wish them a speedy recovery!"
