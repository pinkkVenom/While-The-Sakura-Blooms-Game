"[When you arrive at the exhibition hall, you can see the vibrant and emotional art pieces created by Emi herself.]"
"[Emi silently guides you throught the exhibit.]"
"[When she pauses at an art piece, you pause and look onwards as she does.]"
"[After seeing several art pieces, the story becomes clear.]"
"[The first paintings were very colorful, and very exciting.]"
"[The paintings after that stayed colorful, but became more violent.]"
"[Eventually the pieces were a mess of colors.]"
"[Almost like a scene of gore and carnage, not that that was explicitly painted.]"
"[Finally the end of the exhibit.]"
"[These paintings were less violent, and much more peaceful.]"
"[You couldn't help but notice these final pieces were painted with duller colors.]"
"[What story was Emi trying to tell?]"

"[You and Emi exit the exhibition hall.]"
"[She turns to look at you.]"
"[A smile on her face, but a glossy sheen over her eyes.]"

Emi "I'm glad you enjoyed it."
"The Empress actually first saw this collection when she came to visit the city a while ago."
"She thought the story was so wonderful that it should become a permanent display in the museum."
"It was a very honorable moment."
"Well, I must get back to the art studio."
"Meet me there as soon as possible, I have some more work I need to get done and I could really use your help."
