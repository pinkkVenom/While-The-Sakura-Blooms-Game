"[Yuki is reshelving books when you walk in, his attention caught between the pages and your presence.]"
"[Yuki turns, the faint surprise from your first meeting giving way to a measured smile.]"

Yuki "Ah, you've returned."
"I trust you've been keeping out of trouble, yes?"
"Now, how where do we start?"

narrator "[Yuki nods thoughtfully, pushing his glasses up the bridge of his nose.]"

Yuki "The wisdom of immortals is bound within these tomes."
"Your first task here, then, is to find a scroll."
"Wait actually now that I look at my records..."
"I'm not sure what happened to the scroll..."

choice "ceo"
{
	-Do you have any clues as to where it may be?
}

Yuki "It should be somewhere here..."
"Perhaps it was misplaced outside?"
"Try looking around the library district and see if you can't locate that pesky thing."
"There's some valuable information on that scroll."
"I'd get in a lot of trouble if I lost it."

choice "ceo"
{
	-Do not fear, I'll find it!
}

Yuki "You're a light saver!"
"Thank-you <mainChar>."
"I'll await your return."
