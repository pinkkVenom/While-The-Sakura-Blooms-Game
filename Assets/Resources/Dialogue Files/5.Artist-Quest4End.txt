narrator "[Emi eagerly walks towards you awaitng to hear about your adventure.]"

Emi "How did it go?"
"Was she happy with the painting?"

choice "ceo"
{
	-She loved it a lot
}

Emi "Whew.."
"I'm very glad to hear that."
"If I'm being honest, I was a bit late on finishing it..."

choice "ceo"
{
	-She didn't mention that at all...
}

Emi "Haha well..."
"Perhaps a personalized delivery swayed her emotions on that."
"Thankyou again for doing that."
"I find myself so busy nowadays with the popularity I've amassed."
"Perhaps I should hire an assistant."
"I cannot keep asking you to do things for me, not considering the way I feel about you."
"You’ve become part of my world, part of my art."
"You’ve added color to my life that I didn't know was missing."
"I feel... I feel a connection with you that goes beyond friendship."

narrator "[As Emi steps closer, the space between artist and muse diminishes.]"
"[The studio, once a place of solitary creation, now holds the promise of shared inspiration and a mutual affection that is as vivid and real as the art that surrounds you.]"

Emi "The Empress responded by the way."
"We are formally invited to the Castle."
"I will present some concepts I have for the Empress."
"And while we're there, I will ask her for help getting you home."
"If only I had something really nice to wear..."
"I've been wanting to make a necklace out of moonstone for the longest time now."
"But I've never been able to find any."

choice "ceo"
{
	-I will go find you moonstone
}

Emi "No no it's okay."
"You've already done enough for me."

choice "ceo"
{
	-Please I insist
}

Emi "Okay okay fine."
"But please <mainChar> if you can't find any don't worry about it."

choice "ceo"
{
	-Where is the best location to find some moonstone?
}

Emi "It hides within minerals located in cold and high altitude regions."
"If you head west to the Main Road, then north, then east, there should be a cold mountain area there."
"Perhaps there may be some moonstone there, although I'm not certain there is."

choice "ceo"
{
	-I will do everything I can to find it
	-I want you looking your best for the Empress
