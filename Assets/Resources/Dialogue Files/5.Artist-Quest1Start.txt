Emi "Ah, you're back!"
"I've been thinking about how to help you with your amulet, but first, there's something I need help with."
"I have a deadline for a painting with an important client."
"If I even spend one less second working on this then it'll be late."

Emi "I'm working on a series that requires natural pigments."
"There's a unique pigment powder found in the forest. Could you collect it for me?"
"The hue is as vibrant as the very soul of our realm."
"The pigment comes from a Rose plant."
"They aren't very common in the immortal realm."
"The forest is to the west of the city."
"If you head west to the Main Road, then south, you'll surely find a beautiful forest with a variety of life."

	-I'll find them. Your art deserves nothing less than the full spectrum of this world's beauty.

narrator "[Emi's eyes dance with gratitude.]"

Emi "Thank-you!"
"And be mindful of the forest sprites – they're playful and love to lead travelers on merry chases."
