Doctor "Woah, don't be so hasty"
"You were quite disoriented when we found you. I need to monitor you for a bit longer to make sure you don't have any serious symptoms."

choice "where am i"
{
	-Where am I?
}

Doctor "You're at the hospital hun. You were found by the forest's edge on the outskirts of town"
"What were you doing alone outside the city?"

choice "i was shopping"
{
	-I wasn't outside the city. I was shopping at the thrift store.
}

Doctor "Interesting..."
narrator "[The doctor repeatedly looks at you then back to the clipboard in their hands with concern growing on their face]"

choice "whats wrong"
{
	-What's wrong?
}

Doctor "You're...{a} human?"

choice "im human"
{
	-Obviously
	-Yeah last I checked...
}

Doctor "Ah that explains the disorientation."
"It seems you've gotten transported to the Immortal Realm."

choice "no way"
{
	-The Immortal Realm?
	-That's not possible…
}

Doctor "Yes the realm of the fantastic and supernatural."
"What's this?"
narrator "[The doctor reaches in the direction of your necklace]"
"[They furrow their brow as if studying the markings on the necklace]"
Doctor "It's a shame you stumbled upon this necklace in the human world."

choice "no way"
{
	-What's wrong with it?
}

Doctor "It's imbued with a special power that allows immortals to travel between this world and the human world."
"But these are forbidden now. Immortals have not been allowed to travel to the human realm in many decades."
narrator "(If this got me transported here, maybe it can transport me back.)"
"[You touch the necklace and close your eyes in concentration]"
Doctor "I'm afraid that won't work."

choice "no way"
{
	-Why not?
}

Doctor "The magic in these amulets is unstable."
"They can easily transport an immortal back to their world, but it requires a lot of magical power to bring someone to the human world."
"Humans don't wield magical power so it would be impossible for you to transport yourself back without the use of immortal magic."

choice "no way"
{
	-How can I find a way back home?
	- Why can't you help me?
}

Doctor "I don't know how to operate these ancient amulets. I only know the basic information of their function. I'm afraid my limited knowledge on ancient magic will only hinder you."
"It won't be easy for you to head back unfortunately."
"The most powerful immortal in the land...she would surely have answers for you, but I doubt they would let a commoner, let alone a human, enter the palace so willingly."

choice "no way"
{
	-How can I improve my status?
}

Doctor "I know some immortals that may be able to help you get into the castle."
"One of my nurses Emi is a very kind and reliable individual. She volunteers for the royal kingdom's infirmary."
"The librarian Yuki is incredibly intelligent. He audits the royal archives every few months."
"Kenji is quite the famous immortal. His popularity alone could get you anywhere you'd want to go."
"The artist Hanako is a very expressive person. She frequently gets commissioned to do artwork in the royal palace."
"I've had the pleasure of meeting all these individuals. I am confident one of them can help you get home."

choice "no way"
{
	-Who should I talk to first?
}

Doctor "You should visit each of them and introduce yourself. If they're hesitant to talk to you, let them know I sent you."
"Speaking of which, I need to add your name to my file."

input "Type your name here"

Doctor "Nice to meet you <input>!"
"You look much better now. You're free to go whenever you're ready"
"Just be careful out there. Humans were never meant to be in the immortal world. The longer you stay here, the worse your physical state will become."

choice "no way"
{
	-Could I die if I don't get home?
}

Doctor "..."
"I'm afraid so."
"But you needn't worry about that yet. It takes some time before you'll get really sick, and I'm confident you'll be home by then."
"Now, get going."
"If you have any questions, please let me know."

choice "no way"
{
	-I have more questions
		choice "no way"
		{
			-Is is a long trip to the districts?
				Doctor "Not at all. All the local regions are accessible by foot."
				choice "woah"
				{
					-Is there anything else I should know?
						Doctor"Oh yes there is something serious I must tell you"
						"The Immortal Realm has been in a state of political turmoil for years now."
						"There are two major factions, and they have very polarized followers."
						"Be careful of who you talk to, and what you talk to them about."
						"It might cause you more harm than good."
					}

	-Okay thanks!
